LUCKNOW: The son of the police constable killed in stone-throwing on Saturday in Uttar Pradesh's Ghazipur district has slammed the state police, saying if they were not able to protect their own, what else could be expected from them.   
Constable Suresh Vats was returning from security duty at Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rally in the district when he was hit by a stone. He died on the spot. The police identified the attackers as members of the Nishad Party, which was holding a district-wide agitation to demand greater reservation in government jobs and colleges for their community. Eleven people have been arrested and several others detained in connection with the violence. So far, 32 named and over 100 unidentified people have been named in the FIR.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced a compensation of Rs. 40 lakh for the policeman's wife and Rs. 10 lakh for his parents.

"Police are not being able to protect their own. What can we expect from them? What will we do with compensation now? Earlier, similar incident took place in Bulandshahr," VP Singh, son of Suresh Vats, said.

This was the second time this month that a policeman was killed in mob violence. On December 3, inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was shot dead during violence over cow carcasses in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr.

A policeman who witnessed the incident said Mr Vats died on the spot.

"We tried placating the agitators, but they just wouldn't listen. Instead, they began throwing bricks and stones at us. About three of us were injured, and Suresh died before he could be taken to a hospital," he said.
